<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    Hi, I’m Joshua L Homo, I have a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering and three years of experience in the 
    manufacturing industry, where I learned how to optimize processes, solve problems, and work in a team. However, I 
    realized that my true calling was in web development, so I decided to enroll in a web developer course and learn 
    the latest technologies and best practices in the field. I have completed several projects using HTML, CSS,JavaScript,
    PHP, and WordPress, which you can see in my portfolio below. Some of the features I have implemented include responsive
    design, user authentication, database integration, and e-commerce functionality.
